<!-- # About Me -->
I am a postdoc researcher from [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Tailin Wu](https://tailin.org/). Previously, I worked at [Damo Academy, Alibaba Group](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en). I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Xiaofei He](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/xiaofeihe/) and [Prof. Deng Cai](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/).


# Research Interest
My research interest generally focuses on AI for science, which involves leveraging AI tools to tackle scientific and engineering problems. Specifically, I am interested in developing new AI methods for scientific discovery, simulation, as well as design of novel objects. I am also interested in applying these methods across domains like mechanical engineering, aerospace, and materials design. 
<!-- Additionally, I have a keen interest in generative AI. -->
